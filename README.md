# anuha

`anuha` is a series of articles delving into the details of the advanced concepts of solidity smart contract development. **_aṇuha_** is a Sanskrit word that means _‘he who reaches (=knows) the atoms (= the minute details)’_. And this is my journey of upskilling on the advanced concepts of _Solidity Smart Contract Development, Gas optimization, Yul (/huff), Zero-knowledge proofs, EVM, tools, puzzles, fuzzing,_ and of course _auditing._
